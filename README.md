## Anomaly Detection in Transactions Project_with_MLflow

This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to detect anomalies in online transactions. Identifying anomalous transactions is crucial to ensure the security and trustworthiness of e-commerce platforms, financial institutions, and customers. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this project aims to accurately identify transactions that deviate from normal patterns based on relevant features such as transaction details, user behavior, and historical data.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop robust models that accurately detect anomalous transactions. These models will assist financial institutions and e-commerce platforms in identifying and investigating potential fraudulent activities, thereby enhancing security and reducing financial losses.

### Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing relevant attributes such as transaction amount, transaction date, user behavior metrics, and historical transaction patterns. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

### Techniques:
Machine learning algorithms and techniques explored in this project are:
- Isolation Forest

### Evaluation:
The performance of the model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models.
